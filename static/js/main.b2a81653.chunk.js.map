A common pain point in E2E test automation is that modern Javascript platforms are constantly changing, particularly in the open source community. Many of these frameworks automatically (and dynamically) generate IDs and classes for components resulting in a constantly moving target for automation tooling. Identifying elements by these values (i.e., using IDs, CSS, or xPath locators `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`without`}</em>{` property attributes) makes your tests brittle because they are subject to change any time a new version comes out (or even any time the page is reloaded).`}</p>\n    <p>{`One way to combat this in your own applications is to use dedicated attributes for testing (e.g., `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`test-id`}</inlineCode>{` or `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`dev-id`}</inlineCode>{`). By adding this test-specific attribute to the element, identifying the correct underlying component should be safer. Because this attribute is test-specific and the application logic does not use it, it will be less likely to change throughout the product lifecycle. Combining this approach with other selectors is a common and reliable approach for element identification.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-html\"\n      }}>{`<!-- Component code -->\n<button id=\"login-button\" class=\"default-button\">Login</button>\n\n<!-- Selector to use in a test -->\nWebElement click = driver.findElement(By.id(\"login-button\"));\n`}</code></pre>\n    <h2>{`Testing Frameworks`}</h2>\n    <p>{`There are many tools available for configuring automated E2E tests.
