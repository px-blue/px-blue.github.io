If you do not have your own designers, we can work with you to build\nthe icon you need. We can either build the icon in house or recommend external resources that you can\nuse. Please note that going this route may take extra time, so try to get requests in as early as\npossible. If you are making your own icons, please consider contributing these back into the PX Blue\nicon library (subject to review).`}</p>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/illustration-light-theme.cb4a5096.svg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/illustration-dark-theme.9b797bbe.svg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/illustration-background.788928ed.png\";","\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { mdx } from '@mdx-js/react'\n\n/* @jsxRuntime classic */\n/* @jsx mdx */\nimport { MaterialDesignDescription, ImageGrid } from '../../app/components';\nimport { PictureAsPdf as PDFIcon } from '@material-ui/icons';\nimport LightThemeImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/illustrations/illustration-light-theme.svg';\nimport DarkThemeImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/illustrations/illustration-dark-theme.svg';\nimport BackgroundShapeImage from '../../app/assets/design-patterns/illustrations/illustration-background.png';\n\n\nconst layoutProps = {\n  \n};\nconst MDXLayout = \"wrapper\"\nexport default function MDXContent({\n  components,\n  ...props\n}) {\n  return <MDXLayout {...layoutProps} {...props} components={components} mdxType=\"MDXLayout\">\n\n    {\n      /* KEYWORDS: design illustration graph onboarding */\n    }\n    <h1>{`Illustrations`}</h1>\n    <p>{`Illustrations are design elements that should be used mostly for onboarding screens and `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/patterns/empty-states\"\n      }}>{`empty states`}</a>{`.

They focus primarily on the flow of the application, making sure that a user's journey through the application has the expected outcomes. These tests can generally be categorized as:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><strong parentName=\"li\">{`Acceptance Tests`}</strong>{`: verify that various features and flows meet the customer expectations.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><strong parentName=\"li\">{`Regression Tests`}</strong>{`: verify that existing functionality is not broken when new features are added.`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`They should cover user stories that span multiple components and views, such as signing up for an accounts, logging in and out of the application, updating a profile, etc. These tests are not concerned with the underlying state or implementation of the application - just the end results.`}</p>\n    <p>{`End-to-end tests usually run in a browser against a live system (in the case of web, using a test runner that automates the browser).

Unit tests aim to provide code coverage depth, while functional tests provide coverage over the breadth of user test scenarios.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`How to Write`}</h2>\n    <p>{`End-to-end tests rely on the ability to find elements on the screen and interact with them in an automated way.

A common pain point in E2E test automation is that modern Javascript platforms are constantly changing, particularly in the open source community. Many of these frameworks automatically (and dynamically) generate IDs and classes for components resulting in a constantly moving target for automation tooling. Identifying elements by these values (i.e., using IDs, CSS, or xPath locators `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`without`}</em>{` property attributes) makes your tests brittle because they are subject to change any time a new version comes out (or even any time the page is reloaded).`}</p>\n    <p>{`One way to combat this in your own applications is to use dedicated attributes for testing (e.g., `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`test-id`}</inlineCode>{` or `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`dev-id`}</inlineCode>{`). By adding this test-specific attribute to the element, identifying the correct underlying component should be safer. Because this attribute is test-specific and the application logic does not use it, it will be less likely to change throughout the product lifecycle. Combining this approach with other selectors is a common and reliable approach for element identification.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-html\"\n      }}>{`<!-- Component code -->\n<button id=\"login-button\" class=\"default-button\">Login</button>\n\n<!-- Selector to use in a test -->\nWebElement click = driver.findElement(By.id(\"login-button\"));\n`}</code></pre>\n    <h2>{`Testing Frameworks`}</h2>\n    <p>{`There are many tools available for configuring automated E2E tests.

PX Blue has many patterns and guidelines (color usage, typography, iconography, etc.) to address the most common elements and interactions that you might encounter when designing a product. By following these recommendations and using pre-defined resources from PX Blue, your time is free to focus on the elements that make your project unique. In general, we recommend trying to use PX Blue for 80% of your product's needs.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Environment`}</h2>\n    <p>{`We host and maintain all `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/resources/designer\"\n      }}>{`our design assets`}</a>{` through Figma.

Examples of pages include \"login (empty fields)\" and \"create password (invalid)\".`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Workflows`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Workflows are a sequence of pages combined with rules surrounding how a user goes from one page to another. These usually represent a common path that a user is expected to take to complete various tasks. Workflows that are defined in PX Blue are intended to be nearly identical between applications. Examples of very common workflows include the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/patterns/user-auth\"\n      }}>{`login`}</a>{` experience and user registration / sign up.`}</p>\n    <Divider mdxType=\"Divider\" />\n    <h1>{`Design Patterns`}</h1>\n    <RegularWidth mdxType=\"RegularWidth\">\n    <ImageGrid images={[PatternStatesImg]} regularWidth mdxType=\"ImageGrid\" />\n    </RegularWidth>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/patterns\"\n      }}>{`Design patterns`}</a>{` are very common in PX Blue.
