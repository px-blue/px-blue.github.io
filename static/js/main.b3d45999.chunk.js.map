In general, every time you write a new piece of code or update existing code, you should also write a test that verifies that your code is correct.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Tests come in a variety of different flavors. The following sections discuss Unit Tests and End-to-End (E2E) Tests.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Unit Testing`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Unit testing focuses on testing small pieces of your application (such as testing that functions return the expected values for various inputs). These will likely make up the bulk of your tests. They are quick to write, easy to automate, and can help you achieve significant code coverage.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Angular, React, and React Native all come with built-in unit testing frameworks (if you are using the respective CLI tools).
